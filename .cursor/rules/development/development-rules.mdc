## Code Quality

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Keep functions and classes focused and single-purpose
- Follow defensive programming practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Architecture

- Separate concerns clearly across layers (presentation, business logic, data)
- Use dependency injection to decouple components
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Design APIs that are easy to use and extend
- Apply Domain-Driven Design for complex projects
- Follow SOLID principles

## Security

- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Follow OWASP top 10 guidelines
- Use HTTPS for all API endpoints
- Implement proper session management

## Performance

- Optimize database queries to avoid N+1 problems
- Implement caching for static data and expensive queries
- Avoid blocking operations in event loops
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Lazy load components and modules when possible
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms

## Error Handling

- Handle all exceptions and errors gracefully
- Provide helpful but safe error messages
- Log errors properly with sufficient context for debugging
- Implement retry mechanisms for unstable operations
- Use circuit breakers for external services
- Create fallback plans for critical operations

## Testing

- Write unit tests with high test coverage
- Implement integration tests for critical flows
- Use mocking to isolate dependencies
- Follow testing pyramid (many unit tests, fewer e2e tests)
- Write tests that are easy to read and maintain
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Automate test execution

## API Design

- Use RESTful principles or GraphQL
- Version APIs properly
- Provide comprehensive documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Implement proper error responses with HTTP status codes
- Follow JSON standards
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement rate limiting and throttling

## Development Workflow

- Use version control (Git) effectively
- Follow conventional commits
- Perform code reviews for all non-trivial changes
- Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- Ensure backwards compatibility when possible
- Use feature branches for new development
- Keep main branch stable and deployable

## Configuration

- Use environment variables for configuration
- Separate configuration from code
- Implement configuration validation
- Use sensible default values
- Document all configuration options
- Use configuration management tools
- Implement configuration versioning

## Documentation

- Write clear and comprehensive documentation
- Keep documentation up to date
- Use consistent documentation format
- Include code examples
- Document API endpoints
- Create user guides and tutorials
- Maintain changelog

## Code Organization

- Organize code into logical modules
- Use consistent file and folder naming
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Keep related files together
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Maintain clean code structure

## Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use dependency management tools
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Document dependency choices
- Use lock files for reproducible builds
- Regularly audit dependencies for security issues

## Monitoring and Logging

- Implement comprehensive logging
- Use structured logging formats
- Monitor application performance
- Set up alerting for critical issues
- Track user behavior and errors
- Implement health checks
- Use monitoring tools effectively

## Code Review Guidelines

- Review code for functionality, not just style
- Check for security vulnerabilities
- Verify test coverage
- Ensure code follows project standards
- Look for potential performance issues
- Check for proper error handling
- Verify documentation is updated

## Refactoring

- Refactor code regularly to improve quality
- Use automated refactoring tools when possible
- Test thoroughly after refactoring
- Refactor in small, incremental steps
- Document refactoring decisions
- Maintain backwards compatibility

## Best Practices

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Use immutable data structures when possible
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Avoid premature optimization
- Write self-documenting code
- Use type systems effectively

## Language-Specific Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use modern JavaScript features
- Implement proper async/await patterns
- Use proper module systems

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints
- Implement proper exception handling
- Use virtual environments
- Follow Python best practices

### Java
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Use proper package structure
- Implement proper exception handling
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Follow Java best practices

### C#
- Follow C# naming conventions
- Use proper namespace structure
- Implement proper exception handling
- Use LINQ effectively
- Follow .NET best practices
